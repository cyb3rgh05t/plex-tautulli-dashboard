## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- Plex Media Server with a valid Plex Token
- Tautulli installed and configured with API Key

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyb3rgh05t/plex-tautulli-dashboard.git
cd plex-tautulli-dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content (customize as needed):

```bash
TZ=Europe/Berlin
NODE_ENV=development
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3005
PORT=3006
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3006
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3006
PROXY_TIMEOUT=30000
PROXY_READ_TIMEOUT=30000
PROXY_WRITE_TIMEOUT=30000
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the frontend (port 3005) and backend (port 3006) servers concurrently.

## üîß Configuration

On first run, you'll be presented with a setup wizard that requires:

1. **Plex Server URL**: The full URL to your Plex Media Server (e.g., `http://your-plex-server:32400`)
2. **Plex Token**: Your authentication token for Plex API access
3. **Tautulli URL**: The full URL to your Tautulli instance (e.g., `http://your-tautulli-server:8181`)
4. **Tautulli API Key**: Your Tautulli API key for authentication

### How to find your Plex Token

1. Log in to Plex Web App
2. Open any media item
3. Click the ‚ãÆ (three dots) menu
4. Select "Get Info"
5. Open browser developer tools (F12)
6. Go to the Network tab
7. Look for API requests to Plex - the `X-Plex-Token` parameter will be visible in the request URL

### How to find your Tautulli API Key

1. Open Tautulli web interface
2. Go to Settings > Web Interface
3. In the "API" section, you'll find your API key

## üìã Usage

### Dashboard Navigation

The dashboard is organized into several tabs:

- **Plex Activities**: Real-time view of current downloads and streams
- **Recently Added**: Browse your most recently added media
- **Libraries**: Select which Plex libraries to display on your dashboard
- **Users**: View user statistics and activity
- **Format Settings**: Customize how media information is displayed
- **API Endpoints**: Documentation for available API endpoints

### Custom Formatting

One of the key features of this dashboard is the ability to create custom formats for displaying information. You can create templates with variables specific to:

- **Downloads**: Format how download activities are displayed
- **Recently Added Media**: Customize how movies, TV shows, and music appear
- **Users**: Format how user activity is displayed
- **Sections**: Format how Sections is displayed

For example, you could create a TV show format like:

```bash
{grandparent_title} S{parent_media_index}E{media_index} - {title} ({addedAt:relative})
```

Which would display as:

```bash
Breaking Bad S05E07 - Say My Name (2 days ago)
```

## üåê API Endpoints

The dashboard includes a full-featured API that can be accessed by other applications:

- `GET /api/downloads`: Get all current Plex downloads
- `GET /api/formats`: Get all configured format templates
- `GET /api/sections`: Get all saved library sections
